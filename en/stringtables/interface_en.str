loading_tiptitle				Game Hint
loading_tip1					Holding ^gCONTROL^* while using the shop will display recipe scrolls instead of the item, allowing you to quickly purchase the recipe.
loading_tip2					While using an ability, you can hold ^gSHIFT^* and select another ability to put it in your ability queue. As soon as the first ability has completed the next ability will fire immediately after.
loading_tip3					You can attack your own creeps when they are low health. If you kill them it results in a "deny" and surrounding enemies get much less experience than they would normally.
loading_tip4					If you attack your tower when it is low and destroy it, the enemy team gets much less gold than if they had destroyed it themselves.
loading_tip5					Typing /matchup or /ma in game will print a list of all the players, heroes, levels, and player colors.
loading_tip6					You can sell an item from your stash by holding ^gSHIFT^* and ^gCONTROL^* when ^gRIGHT ^gCLICKING^* an item.
loading_tip7					You can quickly transfer an item between your stash and inventory by holding ^gCONTROL^* and ^gRIGHT ^gCLICKING^* the item.
loading_tip8					Lost track of where your hero is? Tapping the ^gC^* key will center the screen on your hero.
loading_tip9					Magic Armor reduces the damage you take from Magic damage, which includes many spells and abilities.
loading_tip10					Try to always have at least one Homecoming Stone. You never know when you'll need to help defend the other side of the map or use it to avoid being ganked.
loading_tip11					Holding ground (^gH^* by default) will stop your hero from attacking or moving, allowing you to time last hits with more precision.
loading_tip12					You can quickly share control of a courier with other players by clicking the small arrows above their pictures on the left side of the screen.
loading_tip13					Wards of Sight are an inexpensive way to gain a large advantage over opponents by watching where they go and who they are with.
loading_tip14					In the beginning of the game, never leave the base without a way to heal yourself.
loading_tip15					Kongor respawns 10 minutes after he is killed and reclaims the Token of Life if it has not been used.
loading_tip16					Kongor drops the Token of Life when killed. The Token resurrects the holder instantly when they die, but is consumed in the process.
loading_tip17					Fear the Chiprel!
loading_tip18					A special powerup spawns every two minutes in the river and can grant you movement speed, invisibility, regeneration, double damage, or illusions.
loading_tip19					Neutral creeps respawn every minute as long as nothing is nearby. 
loading_tip20					You can sell back an item for a full refund as long as it is within 15 seconds of when you bought it.
loading_tip21					Killing the entire enemy team is called a Genocide.
loading_tip22					At the beginning of the game you cannot take many hits before dying, so make sure to stay behind your creeps and not take much damage.
loading_tip23					When the opposing team has heroes with invisibility, use Dust of Revelation, Wards of Revelation, or a Bound Eye to reveal them.
loading_tip24					Recipes are not useful on their own, you need all of the components before they will do anything for you.
loading_tip25					In the early game, if an enemy hero in your lane goes missing suddenly, be sure to let your team know. It can prevent them from being unexpectedly killed.
loading_tip26					Teamwork is essential to win. If you find yourself getting killed a lot while alone, stick with some allies. 
loading_tip27					Watch the Minimap. It is a great tool for keeping an eye on your enemies position. Be careful for missing enemy heroes or allies coming to help you kill in your lane.
loading_tip28					Communication is important. Talk to your team, call for help, and listen to other players when they call a hero missing. 
loading_tip29					To ping the minimap and alert your team, hold ^gALT^* and click an area! 
loading_tip30					There is more than one way to play a hero. Try picking different items you might not normally use.
loading_tip31					Couriers can be used to fill up bottles from the fountain.
loading_tip32					Attacking enemy heroes when they are focusing on your teammate (and therefore ignoring you) can often turn a bad situation around. Use the opponents distraction to your advantage.
loading_tip33					There are lots of places you can enter the trees to hide or take shortcuts. Learning where these are will greatly increase your survival chances.
loading_tip34					When you read "Superior Magic" in a skill description, it means the skill will affect the target, even if it is magic immune.
loading_tip35					Look to see what skills are on cooldown from your team by highlighting their portraits top left.
loading_tip36					Your team will appreciate you more if you use high damage nukes early in fights rather than as finishers.
loading_tip37					You can see the gold, skills, health, and mana, of your allies at the top left of your screen. If you select their hero, you can see their items.
loading_tip38					Do not be afraid to lose. Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment. Everyone was new at one point.
loading_tip39					Be nice! A player will often ignore advice if you are screaming at them. Try saying it in a polite tone as a suggestion more than an order.
loading_tip40					Typing /gameinfo or /gi in game will print a list of the current game options.
loading_tip41					Clicking on this hint box will display a new hint.
loading_tip42					Selecting a ^!yRegion^* and enabling the "Filter Pre-Query" checkbox on game browser interface will allow you to browse and refresh games faster.
loading_tip43					When a notification pops up in game, you can ^gRIGHT ^gCLICK^* anywhere on it to close it rather than clicking the 'X' button.
loading_tip44					You can turn specific notifications on or off, or disable notifications in game by clicking "Options" and then navigating to the "Interface" tab.
loading_tip45					Each team can only pause up to 3 times per game. Use them wisely!
